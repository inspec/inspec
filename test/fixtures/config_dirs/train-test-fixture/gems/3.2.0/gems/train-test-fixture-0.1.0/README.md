This is a very simple train transport plugin. It provided fixed responses to file.content and command.stdout/stderr/exit_status.

It is not a good example to use for learning, nor a good base for starting your own plugin - it's intended for for use during the testing of Train.

For good examples of plugin development, see train/examples/plugin.

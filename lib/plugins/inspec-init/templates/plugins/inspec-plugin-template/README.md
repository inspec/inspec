# <%= module_name %> Plugin

This plugin was generated by `inspec init plugin`, and apparently the author, '<%= author_name %>', did not update the README.

## To Install This Plugin

```
you@machine $ inspec plugin install <%= plugin_name %>
```

## What This Plugin Does

No idea.

## Developing This Plugin

The generated plugin contains everything a real-world, industrial grade plugin would have, including:

* an (possibly incomplete) implementation of one or more InSpec Plugin Types
* documentation (you are reading it now)
* tests, at the unit and functional level
* a .gemspec, for packaging and publishing it as a gem
* a Gemfile, for managing its dependencies
* a Rakefile, for running development tasks
* Rubocop linting support for using the base InSpec project rubocop.yml (See Rakefile)

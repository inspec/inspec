# Plugin Definition file
# The purpose of this file is to declare to InSpec what plugin_types (capabilities)
# are included in this plugin, and provide activator that will load them as needed.

# It is important that this file load successfully and *quickly*.
# Your plugin's functionality may never be used on this InSpec run; so we keep things
# fast and light by only loading heavy things when they are needed.

# Presumably this is light
require "inspec-suggest/version"

# The InspecPlugins namespace is where all plugins should declare themselves.
# The "Inspec" capitalization is used throughout the InSpec source code; yes, it's
# strange.
module InspecPlugins
  # Pick a reasonable namespace here for your plugin. A reasonable choice
  # would be the CamelCase version of your plugin gem name.

  module Suggest
    # This simple class handles the plugin definition, so calling it simply Plugin is OK.
    #   Inspec.plugin returns various Classes, intended to be superclasses for various
    # plugin components. Here, the one-arg form gives you the Plugin Definition superclass,
    # which mainly gives you access to the activator / plugin_type DSL.
    #   The number '2' says you are asking for version 2 of the plugin API. If there are
    # future versions, InSpec promises plugin API v2 will work for at least two more InSpec
    # major versions.

      # The argument here will be used to match against the command line args,
      # and if the user said `inspec list-resources`, this activator will get called.
      # Notice that you can define multiple activators with different names, and they
      # don't have to match the plugin name.

        # functionality.
        # For example, InSpec will activate this activator when `inspec help` is
        # executed, so that this plugin's usage message will be included in the help.

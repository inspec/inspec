# This file is known as the "entry point."
# This is the file InSpec will try to load if it

# The *only* thing this file should do is setup the
# load path, then load the plugin definition file.

# Next two lines simply add the path of the gem to the load path.
# This is not needed when being loaded as a gem; but when doing
# plugin development, you may need it.  Either way, it's harmless.

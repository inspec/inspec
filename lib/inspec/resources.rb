# Now that resources are lazily loaded, this file is ONLY here for one
# reason at this point, to load all the resources in order to populate
# the registry for `inspec shell`'s `help commands`. There has to be a
# cheaper way to do this, but this will do for now.
#
# NOTE: I intentionally didn't convert this to a loop over a simple
# glob so this remains a sort of manifest for our resources.

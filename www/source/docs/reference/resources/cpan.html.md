# cpan

Use the `cpan` Chef InSpec audit resource to test Perl modules that are installed by system packages or the CPAN installer.

<br>

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with Chef InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v1.43.5 of InSpec.

## Syntax

A `cpan` resource block declares a package and (optionally) a package version:

    describe cpan('package_name') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

where

* `'package_name'` is the name of the package, such as `'DBD::Pg'`
* `be_installed` tests to see if the package described above is installed

<br>

## Resource Parameters

This resource uses package names and perl library paths as resource parameters.

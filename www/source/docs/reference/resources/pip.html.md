# pip

Use the `pip` Chef InSpec audit resource to test packages that are installed using the Python PIP installer.

<br>

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with Chef InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v1.0.0 of InSpec.

## Syntax

A `pip` resource block declares a package and (optionally) a package version:

    describe pip('package_name') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

where

* `'package_name'` is the name of the package, such as `'Jinja2'`
* `be_installed` tests to see if the package described above is installed

<br>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this Chef InSpec audit resource.

### Test if Jinja2 is installed on the system

    describe pip('Jinja2') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

### Test if Jinja2 2.8 is installed on the system

    describe pip('Jinja2') do
      it { should be_installed }
      its('version') { should eq '2.8' }
    end

### Test packages installed into a non-default location (e.g. virtualenv) by passing a custom path to pip executable

    describe pip('Jinja2', '/path/to/bin/pip') do
      it { should be_installed }
      its('version') { should eq '2.8' }
    end

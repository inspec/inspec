Use the `chrony_conf` Chef InSpec audit resource to test the synchronization settings defined in the `chrony.conf` file. This file is typically located at `/etc/chrony.conf`.

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with Chef InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v1.0.0 of InSpec.

## Syntax

An `chrony_conf` resource block declares the synchronization settings that should be tested:

    describe chrony_conf('path') do
      its('setting_name') { should eq 'value' }
    end

where

- `'setting_name'` is a synchronization setting defined in the `chrony.conf` file
- `('path')` is the non-default path to the `chrony.conf` file (default path is `/etc/chrony.conf`)
- `{ should eq 'value' }` is the value that is expected

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this Chef InSpec audit resource.

### Test for clock drift against named servers

    describe chrony_conf do
      its('driftfile') { should cmp '/var/lib/chrony/drift' }
      its('server') do
        should cmp [
          '0.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org',
          '1.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org',
          '2.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org'
        ]
      end
    end

Use the `command` Chef InSpec audit resource to test an arbitrary command that is run on the system.

## Availability

### Installation

{{% inspec/inspec_installation %}}

### Version

This resource first became available in v1.0.0 of InSpec.

## Syntax

A `command` resource block declares a command to be run, one (or more) expected values, and the location to which that output is sent:

    describe command('command') do
      it { should exist }
      its('property') { should eq 'value' }
    end

where

- `'command'` must specify a command to be run
- `'property'` is one of `exit_status`, `stderr`, or `stdout`
- `'output'` tests the output of the command run on the system versus the output value stated in the test

## Property Examples

The following examples show how to use this Chef InSpec audit resource.

### exit_status

The `exit_status` property tests the exit status for the command:

    its('exit_status') { should eq 123 }

### stderr

The `stderr` property tests results of the command as returned in standard error (stderr):

    its('stderr') { should eq 'error' }

### stdout

The `stdout` property tests results of the command as returned in standard output (stdout). The following example shows matching output using a regular expression:

    describe command('echo 1') do
       its('stdout') { should match (/[0-9]/) }
    end

### Test standard output (stdout)

    describe command('echo hello') do
      its('stdout') { should eq "hello\n" }
      its('stderr') { should eq '' }
      its('exit_status') { should eq 0 }
    end

### Test standard error (stderr)

    describe command('>&2 echo error') do
      its('stdout') { should eq '' }
      its('stderr') { should eq "error\n" }
      its('exit_status') { should eq 0 }
    end

### Test an exit status code

    describe command('exit 123') do
      its('stdout') { should eq '' }
      its('stderr') { should eq '' }
      its('exit_status') { should eq 123 }
    end

### Test if the command shell exists

    describe command('/bin/sh').exist? do
      it { should eq true }
    end

### Test for a command that should not exist

    describe command('this is not existing').exist? do
      it { should eq false }
    end

### Test for PostgreSQL database running a RC, development, or beta release

    describe command('psql -V') do
      its('stdout') { should eq '/RC/' }
      its('stdout') { should_not eq '/DEVEL/' }
      its('stdout') { should_not eq '/BETA/' }
    end

### Verify NTP

The following example shows how to use the `file` audit resource to verify if the `ntp.conf` and `leap-seconds` files are present, and then the `command` resource to verify if NTP is installed and running:

    describe file('/etc/ntp.conf') do
       it { should be_file }
    end

    describe file('/etc/ntp.leapseconds') do
      it { should be_file }
    end

    describe command('pgrep ntp') do
       its('exit_status') { should eq 0 }
    end

### Verify WiX

Wix includes several tools -- such as `candle` (preprocesses and compiles source files into object files), `light` (links and binds object files to an installer database), and `heat` (harvests files from various input formats). The following example uses a whitespace array and the `file` audit resource to verify if these three tools are present:

    %w(
      candle.exe
      heat.exe
      light.exe
    ).each do |utility|
      describe file("C:/wix/##{utility}") do
        it { should be_file }
      end
    end

### Timing Out Long-Running Commands

On target platforms that support the feature, the command resource takes an optional `timeout:` parameter which specifies how long the command may run in seconds before erroring out and failing the control.

```ruby
describe command("find / -owner badguy", timeout: 300) do
  its("stdout") { should be_empty }
end
```

This example would run the `find` command for up to 300 seconds, then give up and fail the control if it exceeded that time.
On supported target platforms, the default timeout is 3600 seconds (one hour).

Aside from setting the value on a per-resource basis, you may also use the `--command-timeout` CLI option to globally set a command timeout. The CLI option takes precedence over any per-resource `timeout:` options.

Currently supported target platforms include:
 * Local Unix-like OSes, including macOS
 * SSH targets
 * Windows targets via WinRM

Any target platforms not listed are not supported at this time.

On unsupported platforms, the timeout value is ignored and the command will run indefinitely.

### Redacting Sensitive Commands

By default the command that is ran is shown in the Chef InSpec output. This can be problematic if the command contains sensitive arguments such as a password. These sensitive parts can be redacted by passing in `redact_regex` and a regular expression to redact. Optionally, you can use 2 capture groups to fine tune what is redacted.

The following examples show how to use `redact_regex`:

    # Example without capture groups
    describe command('myapp -p secret_password -d no_redact', redact_regex: /-p .* -d/) do
      its('exit_status') { should cmp 0 }
    end

    # Result (no capture groups used)
    Command: `myapp REDACTED no_redact`
       ✔  exit_status should cmp == 0

    # Example with capture groups
    # Each set of parenthesis is a capture group.
    # Anything in the two capture groups will not be 'REDACTED'
    describe command('myapp -p secret_password -d no_redact', redact_regex: /(-p ).*( -d)/) do
      its('exit_status') { should cmp 0 }
    end

    # Result (capture groups used)
    Command: `myapp -p REDACTED -d no_redact`
       ✔  exit_status should cmp == 0

### exist

The `exist` matcher tests if a command may be run on the system:

    it { should exist }

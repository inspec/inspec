# The following (private) boxes are shared via VagrantCloud and are only
# available to users working for Chef. Sorry, it's about software licensing.
#
# Chef-internal users, you will need to:
# 1.  Create an VagrantCloud account:  https://app.vagrantup.com/
# 2.  Ping #eng-services-support with your VagrantCloud account name
#     to be added to the relevant team in VagrantCloud,
# 3.  Do `vagrant login` with your VagrantCloud creds so that you can download
#     the private boxes.
#
# The macOS boxes are VMware only also. You can enable VMware Fusion
# by activating the `.kitchen.vmware.yml` file with the `KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML`
# environment variable:
#
#   KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=.kitchen.vmware.yml kitchen converge inspec-macosx-109

# aws\_sns\_topic

Use the `aws_sns_topic` Chef InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS Simple Notification Service Topic.  SNS topics are channels for related events. AWS resources place events in the SNS topic, while other AWS resources _subscribe_ to receive notifications when new events have appeared.

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with Chef InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v2.0.16 of InSpec.

## Syntax

    # Ensure that a topic exists and has at least one subscription
    describe aws_sns_topic('arn:aws:sns:*::my-topic-name') do
      it { should exist }
      its('confirmed_subscription_count') { should_not be_zero }
    end

    # You may also use has syntax to pass the ARN
    describe aws_sns_topic(arn: 'arn:aws:sns:*::my-topic-name') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Resource Parameters

### ARN

This resource expects a single parameter that uniquely identifies the SNS Topic, an ARN. Amazon Resource Names for SNS topics have the format `arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:topicname`.  AWS requires a fully-specified ARN for looking up an SNS topic.  The account ID and region are required.  Wildcards are not permitted.

See also the [AWS documentation on ARNs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).

title: About the aws_sns_topic Resource

# aws\_sns\_topic

Use the `aws_sns_topic` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS Simple Notification Service Topic.  SNS topics are channels for related events. AWS resources place events in the SNS topic, while other AWS resources _subscribe_ to receive notifications when new events have appeared.

## Syntax

  # Ensure that a topic exists and has at least one subscription
  describe aws_sns_topic('arn:aws:sns:*::my-topic-name') do
    it { should exist }
    its('confirmed_subscription_count') { should_not be_zero }
  end

  # You may also use has syntax to pass the ARN
  describe aws_sns_topic(arn: 'arn:aws:sns:*::my-topic-name') do
    it { should exist }
  end

## Resource Parameters

### ARN

This resource expects a single parameter that uniquely identifes the SNS Topic, an ARN. Amazon Resource Names for SNS topics have the format `arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:topicname`.  AWS requires a fully-specified ARN for looking up an SNS topic.  The account ID and region are required.  Wildcards are not permitted.

See also the (AWS documentation on ARNs)[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html].

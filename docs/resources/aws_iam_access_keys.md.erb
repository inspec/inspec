# aws\_iam\_access\_keys

Use the `aws_iam_access_keys` Chef InSpec audit resource to test properties of some or all IAM Access Keys.

To test properties of a single Access Key, use the `aws_iam_access_key` resource instead.
To test properties of an individual user's access keys, use the `aws_iam_user` resource.

Access Keys are closely related to AWS User resources. Use this resource to perform audits of all keys or of keys specified by criteria unrelated to any particular user.

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with Chef InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v2.0.16 of InSpec.

## Syntax

An `aws_iam_access_keys` resource block uses an optional filter to select a group of access keys and then tests that group.

    # Do not allow any access keys
    describe aws_iam_access_keys do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

    # Don't let fred have access keys, using filter argument syntax
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where(username: 'fred') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

    # Don't let fred have access keys, using filter block syntax (most flexible)
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { username == 'fred' } do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

<br>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this Chef InSpec audit resource.

### Disallow access keys created more than 90 days ago

    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { created_days_ago > 90 } do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

<br>

## Filter Criteria
* `active`, `create_date`, `created_days_ago`, `created_hours_ago`, `created_with_user`, `ever_used`, `inactive`, `last_used_date`, `last_used_hours_ago`, `last_used_days_ago`, `never_used`, `user_created_date`

<br>

## Filter Examples

### active

A true / false value indicating if an Access Key is currently "Active" (the normal state) in the AWS console. See also: `inactive`.

    # Check if a particular key is enabled
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { active } do
      its('access_key_ids') { should include('AKIA1234567890ABCDEF')}
    end

### create\_date

A DateTime identifying when the Access Key was created. See also `created_days_ago` and `created_hours_ago`.

    # Detect keys older than 2017
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { create_date < DateTime.parse('2017-01-01') } do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### created\_days\_ago, created\_hours\_ago

An integer, representing how old the access key is.

    # Don't allow keys that are older than 90 days
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { created_days_ago > 90 } do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### created\_with\_user

A true / false value indicating if the Access Key was likely created at the same time as the user, by checking if the difference between created_date and user_created_date is less than 1 hour.

    # Do not automatically create keys for users
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { created_with_user } do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### ever\_used

A true / false value indicating if the Access Key has ever been used, based on the last_used_date. See also: `never_used`.

    # Check to see if a particular key has ever been used
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { ever_used } do
      its('access_key_ids') { should include('AKIA1234567890ABCDEF')}
    end

### inactive

A true / false value indicating if the Access Key has been marked Inactive in the AWS console. See also: `active`.

    # Don't leave inactive keys laying around
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { inactive } do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### last\_used\_date

A DateTime identifying when the Access Key was last used. Returns nil if the key has never been used. See also: `ever_used`, `last_used_days_ago`, `last_used_hours_ago`, and `never_used`.

    # No one should do anything on Mondays
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { ever_used and last_used_date.monday? } do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### last\_used\_days\_ago, last\_used\_hours\_ago

An integer representing when the key was last used. See also: `ever_used`, `last_used_date`, and `never_used`.

    # Don't allow keys that sit unused for more than 90 days
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { last_used_days_ago > 90 } do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### never\_used

A true / false value indicating if the Access Key has never been used, based on the `last_used_date`. See also: `ever_used`.

    # Don't allow unused keys to lay around
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { never_used } do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### username

Searches for access keys owned by the named user. Each user may have zero, one, or two access keys.

    describe aws_iam_access_keys(username: 'bob') do
      it { should exist }
    end

### user\_created\_date

The date at which the user was created.

    # Users have to be a week old to have a key
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where { user_created_date > Date.now - 7 }
      it { should_not exist }
    end

<br>

## Properties

* `access_key_ids`, `entries`

## Property Examples

### access\_key\_ids

Provides a list of all access key IDs matched.

    describe aws_iam_access_keys do
      its('access_key_ids') { should include('AKIA1234567890ABCDEF') }
    end

### entries

Provides access to the raw results of the query. This can be useful for checking counts and other advanced operations.

    # Allow at most 100 access keys on the account
    describe aws_iam_access_keys do
      its('entries.count') { should be <= 100}
    end

<br>

## Matchers

This Chef InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exists

The control will pass if the filter returns at least one result. Use `should_not` if you expect zero matches.

    # Sally should have at least one access key
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where(username: 'sally') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # Don't let fred have access keys
    describe aws_iam_access_keys.where(username: 'fred') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `iam:ListAccessKeys`, and `iam:ListUsers` action with Effect set to Allow.

You can find detailed documentation at [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Identity And Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_identityandaccessmanagement.html).

# aws\_elbs

Use the `aws_elbs` Chef InSpec audit resource to test properties of AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs, also known as a Classic Load Balancers) in bulk, or to search for a group of them based on their properties.

To audit a specific ELB in detail when its name is known, use `aws_elb` (singular).

<br>

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with Chef InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v2.2.10 of InSpec.

## Syntax

An `aws_elb` resource block uses an optional filter to select a group of ELBs and then tests that group.

    # Check that you have at aleast one ELB
    describe aws_elbs do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # Ensure that you have at least one ELB in a specific VPC
    describe aws_elb.where(vpc_id: 'vpc-12345678') do
      it { should exist }
    end

<br>

## Filter Criteria

Use filter criteria with `where` to search for ELBs by their properties.  `where` may be used in method mode (as in `aws_elbs.where(criterion: value)`) or in block mode (as in `aws_elbs.where { any code here }`). Several criteria on this resource may only be used with block-mode, because they are list-based.

### availability\_zones

An array of strings identifying which availability zones in which the load balancer is located. This criterion must be used with block-mode `where`.

    # Find ELBs with a footprint in us-east-2a
    describe aws_elbs.where {  availability_zones.include? 'us-east-2a' } do
      it { should exist }
    end

### dns\_name

Returns the FQDN of the load balancer.  This is the hostname which is exposed to the world.

    # Find ELBs that have the letter z in their DNS name
    describe aws_elbs.where(dns_name: /z/) do
      it { should exist }
    end

### elb\_name

The name of the ELB within AWS. The ELB name is unique within the region. If you know the full ELB name, you should use the `aws_elb` resource instead, as it is much more efficient for testing a specific ELB.

    # Find ELBs whose name ends in `prod`
    describe aws_elbs.where(elb_name: /prod$/) do
      it { should exist }
    end

### external\_ports

An array of integers reflecting the public-facing ports on which the load balancer will be listening for traffic. This criterion must be used with block-mode `where`.

    # Find ELBs listening on port 80
    describe aws_elbs.where { external_ports.include? 80 } do
      it { should exist }
    end

### instance\_ids

An array of strings reflecting the instance IDs of the EC2 instances attached to the ELB. This criterion must be used with block-mode `where`.

    # Find ELBs with at least 3 instances
    describe aws_elbs.where { instance_ids.count > 2 } do
      it { should exist }
    end


### internal\_ports

An array of integers reflecting the EC2-facing ports on which the load balancer will be sending traffic to. This criterion must be used with block-mode `where`.

    # Find ELBs sending traffic to port 80
    describe aws_elbs.where { internal_ports.include? 80 } do
      it { should exist }
    end

### security\_group\_ids

An array of strings reflecting the security group IDs (firewall rule sets) assigned to the ELB. This criterion must be used with block-mode `where`.

    # Find ELBs using a particular security group
    describe aws_elbs.where { security_group_ids.include? 'sg-12345678' } do
      it { should exist }
    end

### subnet\_ids

An array of strings reflecting the subnet IDs on which the ELB is located. This criterion must be used with block-mode `where`.

    # Find ELBs located on a particular subnet
    describe aws_elbs.where { subnet_ids.include? 'subnet-12345678' } do
      it { should exist }
    end

### vpc\_id

A String reflecting the ID of the VPC in which the ELB is located.

    # Find all ELBs in a specific VPC.
    describe aws_elbs.where(vpc_id: 'vpc-12345678') do
      it { should exist }    
    end

## Properties

### availability\_zones

An array of strings identifying which availability zones in which the selected load balancers are located. The array is de-duplicated.

    # Ensure none of our ELBs are in us-east-1c
    describe aws_elbs do
      its('availability_zones') { should_not include 'us-east-1c' }
    end

### count

Returns an integer reflecting the number of matched ELBs.

    # Ensure we have 4 ELBs total.
    describe aws_elbs do
      its('count') { should cmp 4 }
    end

### dns\_names

An array of FQDNs of the selected load balancers.  These are the hostnames which are exposed to the world.

    # Ensure none of the DNS names are an old name
    describe aws_elbs do
      its('dns_names') { should_not include 'some.horrid.name' }
    end

### elb\_names

The names of the selected ELBs within AWS. The ELB name is unique within the region. 

    # You can use this to enumerate the ELBs for detailed tests
    # Search using the plural, analyze using the singular.
    aws_elbs.where { instance_ports.include? 80 }.elb_names.each do |elb_name|
      describe aws_elb(elb_name) do

## Matchers

This Chef InSpec audit resource has the following resource-specific matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exists

The audit test will pass if at least one ELB was matched by the filter.  Use with `should_not` to test for absence.

    # We like z's in our DNS names
    describe aws_elbs.where(dns_name: /z/) do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # But k's are just awful
    describe aws_elbs.where(dns_name: /k/) do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

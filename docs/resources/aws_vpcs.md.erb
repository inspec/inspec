# aws\_vpcs

Use the `aws_vpcs` InSpec audit resource to test properties of some or all AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).

A VPC is a networking construct that provides an isolated environment. A VPC is contained in a geographic region, but spans availability zones in that region. A VPC may have multiple subnets, internet gateways, and other networking resources. Computing resources--such as EC2 instances--reside on subnets within the VPC.

Each VPC is uniquely identified by its VPC ID. In addition, each VPC has a non-unique CIDR IP Address range (such as 10.0.0.0/16) which it manages.

Every AWS account has at least one VPC, the "default" VPC, in every region.

## Syntax

An `aws_vpcs` resource block uses an optional filter to select a group of VPCs and then tests that group.

    # The control will pass if the filter returns at least one result. Use `should_not` if you expect zero matches.
    describe aws_vpcs do
      it { should exist }
    end

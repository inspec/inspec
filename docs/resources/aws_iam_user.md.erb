# aws\_iam\_user

Use the `aws_iam_user` Chef InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS IAM user.

To test properties of more than one user, use the `aws_iam_users` resource.

To test properties of the special AWS root user (which owns the account), use the `aws_iam_root_user` resource.

## Properties

### attached\_policy\_arns

Returns a list of IAM Managed Policy ARNs as strings that identify the policies that are attached to the user. If there are no attached policies, returns an empty list.

    describe aws_iam_user('bob') do
      # This is a customer-managed policy
      its('attached_policy_arns') { should include 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/test-inline-policy-01' }
      # This is an AWS-managed policy
      its('attached_policy_arns') { should include 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AlexaForBusinessGatewayExecution' }
    end

### attached\_policy\_names

Returns a list of IAM Managed Policy Names as strings that identify the policies that are attached to the user. If there are no attached policies, returns an empty list.

      # This is a customer-managed policy
      its('attached_policy_names') { should include 'test-inline-policy-01' }
      # This is an AWS-managed policy
      its('attached_policy_names') { should include 'AlexaForBusinessGatewayExecution' }
    end

### inline\_policy\_names

      its('inline_policy_names.count') { should eq 1 }

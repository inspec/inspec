# aws\_iam\_user

Use the `aws_iam_user` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS IAM user.

To test properties of more than one user, use the `aws_iam_users` resource.

To test properties of the special AWS root user (which owns the account), use the `aws_iam_root_user` resource.

      it { should exist }
    end

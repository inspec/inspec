# aws\_iam\_groups

Use the `aws_iam_groups` Chef InSpec audit resource to test properties of all or multiple groups.

To test properties of a single group, use the `aws_iam_group` resource.

<br>

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with Chef InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v2.0.16 of InSpec.

## Syntax

An `aws_iam_groups` resource block uses an optional filter to select a collection of IAM groups and then tests that collection.

    # The control will pass if the filter returns at least one result. Use `should_not` if you expect zero matches.
    describe aws_iam_groups do
      it { should exist }
    end

<br>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this Chef InSpec audit resource.

As this is the initial release of `aws_iam_groups`, its limited functionality precludes examples.

## Filter Criteria

### group_name

Filters the IAM groups by their group name, a string.  If you know the exact group name, use `aws_iam_group` (singular) instead.  This criteria may be used when you know a pattern of the name.

    # Use a regex to find groups ending with 'Admins'
    describe aws_iam_groups.where(group_name: /Admins$/) do
      its('group_names') { should include 'FriendlyAdmins' }
      its('group_names') { shoud_not include 'ShunnedAdmins' }
    end

## Properties

### group_names

An Array of Strings, reflecting the IAM group names matched by the filter.  If no groups matched, this will be empty.  You can also use this with `aws_iam_group` to enumerate groups.

    # Check for friendly people
    describe aws_iam_groups.where(group_name: /Admins$/) do
      its('group_names') { should include 'FriendlyAdmins' }
      its('group_names') { should include 'KindAdmins' }
    end

    # Use to loop and fetch groups individually for auditing in detail
    # Without a `where`, this fetches all groups
    aws_iam_groups.group_names.each do |group_names|
      # A roundabout way of saying "bob should not be in any groups"
      describe aws_iam_group(group_name) do
        its('users') { should_not include 'bob' }
      end
    end

## Matchers

This resource has no resource-specific matchers.  For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exists

The control will pass if the filter returns at least one result. Use `should_not` if you expect zero matches.

    describe aws_iam_groups
      it { should exist }
    end

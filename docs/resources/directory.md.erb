title: About the directory Resource
---

# directory

Use the `directory` InSpec audit resource to test if the file type is a directory. This is equivalent to using the `file` resource and the `be_directory` matcher, but provides a simpler and more direct way to test directories. 

<br>

## Syntax

A `directory` resource block declares the location of the directory to be tested, and then one (or more) matchers.

    describe directory('path') do
      its('property') { should cmp 'value' }
    end

<br>

## Properties

All of the properties available to `file` may be used with `directory`.

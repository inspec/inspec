# aws\_iam\_policy

Use the `aws_iam_policy` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single managed AWS IAM Policy.

A policy is an entity in AWS that, when attached to an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when a principal, such as a user, makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine if the request is allowed or denied. 

Each IAM Policy is uniquely identified by either its policy_name or arn.

## Syntax

An `aws_iam_policy` resource block identifies a policy by policy name.

    # Find a policy by name
    describe aws_iam_policy('AWSSupportAccess') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # Find a customer-managed by name
    describe aws_iam_policy('customer-managed-policy') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # Hash syntax for policy name
    describe aws_iam_policy(policy_name: 'AWSSupportAccess') do
      it { should exist }
    end

# aws\_kms\_keys

Use the `aws_kms_keys` Chef InSpec audit resource to test properties of some or all AWS KMS Keys.

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that makes creating and controlling your encryption keys for your data easier. KMS uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of your keys.

AWS Key Management Service is integrated with several other AWS services to help you protect the data you store with these services.

Each AWS KMS Key is uniquely identified by its key-id or key-arn.

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with Chef InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v2.0.16 of InSpec.

## Syntax

An `aws_kms_keys` resource block uses an optional filter to select a group of KMS Keys and then tests that group.

    # Verify the number of KMS keys in the AWS account
    describe aws_kms_keys do
      its('entries.count') { should cmp 10 }
    end

<br>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this Chef InSpec audit resource.

As this is the initial release of `aws_kms_keys`, its limited functionality precludes examples.

<br>

## Properties

* `entries`, `key_arns`, `key_ids`

<br>

## Property Examples

### entries

Provides access to the raw results of a query. This can be useful for checking counts and other advanced operations.

    # Allow at most 100 KMS Keys on the account
    describe aws_kms_keys do
      its('entries.count') { should be <= 100}
    end

### key\_arns

Provides a list of key arns for all KMS Keys in the AWS account.

    describe aws_kms_keys do
      its('key_arns') { should include('arn:aws:kms:us-east-1::key/key-id') }
    end

### key\_ids

Provides a list of key ids for all KMS Keys in the AWS account.

    describe aws_kms_keys do
      its('key_ids') { should include('fd7e608b-f435-4186-b8b5-111111111111') }
    end

## Matchers

This Chef InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

The control will pass if the filter returns at least one result. Use `should_not` if you expect zero matches.

    # Verify that at least one KMS Key exists.
    describe aws_kms_keys
      it { should exist }
    end

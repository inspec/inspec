# aws\_route\_table

Use the `aws_route_table` Chef InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single Route Table. A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with Chef InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v2.0.16 of InSpec.

## Syntax

    # Ensure that a certain route table exists by name
    describe aws_route_table('rtb-123abcde') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Resource Parameters

### route\_table\_id

This resource expects a single parameter that uniquely identifies the Route Table. You may pass it as a string, or as the value in a hash:

    describe aws_route_table('rtb-123abcde') do
      it { should exist }
    end
    # Same
    describe aws_route_table(route_table_id: 'rtb-123abcde') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Matchers

### exist

Indicates that the Route Table provided was found.  Use `should_not` to test for Route Tables that should not exist.

    describe aws_route_table('should-be-there') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_route_table('should-not-be-there') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

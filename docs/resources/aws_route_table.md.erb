# aws\_route\_table

Use the `aws_route_table` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single Route Table. A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

## Syntax

  # Ensure that a certain route table exists by name
  describe aws_route_table('rtb-123abcde') do
    it { should exist }
  end

## Resource Parameters

### route\_table\_id

This resource expects a single parameter that uniquely identifies the Route Table. You may pass it as a string, or as the value in a hash:

  describe aws_route_table('rtb-123abcde') do
    it { should exist }
  end
  # Same
  describe aws_route_table(route_table_id: 'rtb-123abcde') do
    it { should exist }
  end

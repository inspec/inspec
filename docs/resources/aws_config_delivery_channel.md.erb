title: About the aws_config_delivery_channel Resource

# aws\_config\_delivery\_channel

The AWS Config service can monitor and record changes to your AWS resource configurations. A Delivery Channel can record the changes
to an S3 Bucket, an SNS or both.

Use the `aws_config_delivery_channel` Chef InSpec audit resource to examine how the AWS Config service delivers those change notifications.

As of April 2018, each AWS region may have only one Delivery Channel.

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with Chef InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v2.1.21 of InSpec.

## Resource Parameters

An `aws_config_delivery_channel` resource block declares the tests for a single AWS Config Delivery Channel.

You may specify the Delivery Channel name:

    describe aws_config_delivery_channel('my_channel') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_config_delivery_channel(channel_name: 'my-channel') do
      it { should exist }
    end

However, since you may only have one Delivery Channel per region, and Chef InSpec connections are per-region, you may also omit the `channel_name` to obtain the one Delivery Channel (if any) that exists:

    describe aws_config_delivery_channel do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this Chef InSpec audit resource.

### Test how frequently the channel writes configuration changes to the s3 bucket.

    describe aws_config_delivery_channel(channel_name: 'my-recorder') do
      its(delivery_frequency_in_hours) { should be > 3 }
    end

## Properties

### channel\_name

Returns the name of the Delivery Channel.

    describe aws_config_delivery_channel do
      its('channel_name') { should cmp 'my-channel' }
    end

### delivery\_frequency\_in\_hours

Provides how often the AWS Config sends configuration changes to the s3 bucket in the delivery channel.

    describe aws_config_delivery_channel(channel_name: 'my_channel')
      its('delivery_frequency_in_hours') { should eq 24 }
      its('delivery_frequency_in_hours') { should be > 24 }
    end

### s3\_bucket\_name

Provides the name of the s3 bucket that the channel sends configuration changes to. This is an optional value since a Delivery Channel can also talk to an SNS.

    describe aws_config_delivery_channel(channel_name: 'my_channel')
      its('s3_bucket_name') { should eq 'my_bucket' }
    end

### s3\_key\_prefix

Provides the s3 object key prefix (or "path") under which configuration data will be recorded.

    describe aws_config_delivery_channel(channel_name: 'my_channel')
      its('s3_key_prefix') { should eq 'log/' }
    end

### sns\_topic\_arn

Provides the ARN of the SNS topic for which the channel sends notifications about configuration changes.

    describe aws_config_delivery_channel(channel_name: 'my_channel')
      its('sns_topic_arn') { should eq 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:721741954427:sns_topic' }
    end
